# Austin Garcia

I am a 18 year old programmer and mathematician.

I am double majoring in Electrical Engineering and Mathematics at UCSD.

## Programming

I use Python and C, primarily. 

I'm partially versed in a few dozen other languages that I've touched for two or three projects and not really used again.

I'm currently part of the SCC23 travel team for UCSD.

Lisp, Rust, and Haskell are three languages I've been using more lately, but not for any project I've pushed. I'm really enjoying all three of them.

I run Fedora Workstation-38 and use Qtile as my window manager. (I'm very bog-standard about my OS, I'm afraid)

I use neovim as my editor. 

I don't tend to write graphics stuff. I find it difficult.

## Other than programming

First and foremost am a Catholic! 

I listen to [relevant radio](https://relevantradio.com/)

I love reading, writing, and mathematics.

I play piano, saxophone, harmonica, and guitar. 

I've obtained a violin. I need to actually learn how to play it.

I love theatre (The last time I was in a play I was Lumiere in Beauty and the Beast, this is absolutely my favourite play). 

My non-programming languages are Spanish, English, and French.

I do gymnastics and martial arts.

I'm not good at chess, but I enjoy it a lot. 

### Book recomendations

I mentioned I love reading!

I love reading!

Alot!

So a few book recommendations:

Anything by Tolkein (Tolkein is my favorite)

Anything by C.S. Lewis

The Count of Monte Cristo (Alexandre Dumas)

The Complete Sherlock Holmes (Author Conlan Doyle)

The Shadow Children (Margaret Peterson Haddix) (This is an easy but excellent read)

## Mathematics

Tau is the True Circle Constant

I prefer Quaternions over Euler Angles

Imaginary numbers is a misnomerâ€” they are real too

Anyone who knows me knows I somehow manage to make everything into a set theory problem. I don't even like set theory that much anymore.

Lambda Calculus is cool!

[Type Theory](https://hott.github.io/book/hott-online-1404-g79e6d60.pdf) is where it's at.


## Desmos

I have over 400 desmos graphs saved. Here are a few interesting ones:

[Animation of the Unit Circle](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/lzorsicscy)

[Matrices Setup (2d)](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/0qj4jdzyxh)

[Matrices Setup (3d)](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ydnve1a4wd)

[Parametric Axis-Bending Setup](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/v6m8whr37n)

[Fourier Series Setup](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/i35womijug)

[Vector Field Setup](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/rwfthstuvu)

[4d K-map](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/yg1ddxdrdb)

I have a mock-up physics simulation, but it's not quite done. Coming soon! Honestly, I don't know why I always end up doing this kind of stuff in desmos. 

(Probably because its the only graphics system I really understand. I should devote some time to learning... something else? I already do animations in manim, I should just get good at manim.)
