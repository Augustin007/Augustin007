# Austin Garcia

I am a 20 year old programmer and mathematician.

I am double majoring in Electrical Engineering and Mathematics at UCSD.

## Programming

I use Python and C, primarily. 

I'm partially versed in a few dozen other languages that I've touched for two or three projects and not really used again.

I was part of the SCC23 travel team for UCSD. I went to denver. It was fun! I should add pictures somewhere! Our cluster was named Seuss. Third place overall. First US team.

Lisp, Rust, and Haskell are three languages I've been using more lately, but not for any project I've pushed publicly. I'm really enjoying all three of them.

I use neovim as my editor. 

I don't tend to write graphics stuff. I find it difficult and tedious to get things where I would like them to be.

Most of my projects aren't pushed. I occasionally forget I have projects on GitHub for long stretches of time.

## Other than programming

First and foremost am a Catholic! 

I listen to [relevant radio](https://relevantradio.com/)

I love reading, writing, and mathematics.

I play piano, saxophone, harmonica, and guitar. 

I've obtained a violin. I need to actually learn how to play it.

TTRPGs! I've been running D&D campaigns for ages. 

I love theatre (The last time I was in a play I was Lumiere in Beauty and the Beast, this is absolutely my favourite play). 

My non-programming languages are Spanish, English, and French. I studied Latin for a bit but I never learned it, I need to do that.

I do gymnastics and martial arts.

I'm not good at chess, at all, but I enjoy it a lot. 

### Book recomendations

I mentioned I love reading!

I love reading!

Alot!

So a few book recommendations:

Anything by Tolkein (Tolkein is my favorite)

Anything by C.S. Lewis

The Count of Monte Cristo (Alexandre Dumas)

The Complete Sherlock Holmes (Author Conlan Doyle)

The Shadow Children (Margaret Peterson Haddix) (This is an easy but excellent read)

## Mathematics

I prefer Quaternions over Euler Angles.

Imaginary numbers is a misnomerâ€” they are real too.

[Type Theory](https://hott.github.io/book/hott-online-1404-g79e6d60.pdf) is where it's at.

Lambda Calculus is cool!

Currently reading up on automated theorem proving and theorem checking.

## Desmos

I have over 400 desmos graphs saved. Here are a few interesting ones:

[Animation of the Unit Circle](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/lzorsicscy)

[Matrices Setup (2d)](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/0qj4jdzyxh)

[Matrices Setup (3d)](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ydnve1a4wd)

[Parametric Axis-Bending Setup](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/v6m8whr37n)

[Fourier Series Setup](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/i35womijug)

[Vector Field Setup](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/rwfthstuvu)

[4d K-map](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/yg1ddxdrdb)

I have a mock-up physics simulation, but it's not quite done. Coming soon! Honestly, I don't know why I always end up doing this kind of stuff in desmos. 

(Probably because its the only graphics system I really understand. I should devote some time to learning... something else? I already do some animation in manim, I should just get good at manim.)

I have some loose plans about writing desmos esolang compiler at some point?
