# Austin Garcia

I am a 18 year old programmer and mathematician.

I am studying for a degree in Electrical Engineering at UCSD.

## Programming

I know Python and C, I also know a little bit of both C++ and Java, and I used to know MWEX, though I haven't touched it in around a decade. I mostly just use python.

My current project [usefulpy](https://github.com/Augustin007/usefulpy) is a large library of functions that improve the quality of python programming. One catch, it can't use any sort of third party libraries... so no numpy, scipy, manim, or any others... 

I am separating the usefulpy.mathematics section into its own usefulpy-math library, an enormous work in progress. I don't usually push very often, I prefer to finish up a change and iron out the bugs, (which will persist no matter what). As it is a new project, it is mostly just scaffolding code, a lot of empty files, trying to realize the tangle of mathematics, flowcharts, and pseudocode filling up one of my notebooks. More commits for a while as I sort this out.

I use Vim, Visual Studio Code, and Ipython for programming.

I am debating including compiled C programs to improve speed, but I've only used python and C together a few times before, so I've still got a lot to learn. Last week (as of writing this message, 12/19/2022), I spent five hours pondering over what turned out to be the result of a misplaced comma, trying to build a basic c library for python.

## Other than programming

First and foremost am a Catholic! 

I listen to [relevant radio](https://relevantradio.com/)

I love reading, writing, and mathematics.

I play piano, saxophone, and guitar. 

I love theatre (The last time I was in a play I was Lumiere in Beauty and the Beast, this is absolutely my favourite play). 

My non-programming languages are Spanish, English, and French.

I do gymnastics and martial arts.

### Book recomendations

I mentioned I love reading!

I love reading!

Alot!

So a few book recommendations:

Anything by Tolkein (Tolkein is my favorite)

Anything by C.S. Lewis

The Count of Monte Cristo (Alexandre Dumas)

The Complete Sherlock Holmes (Author Conlan Doyle)

The Shadow Children (Margaret Peterson Haddix) (This is an easy but excellent read)

## Mathematics

My favorite number is 6.928203230275509174109536602... 

Tau is the True Circle Constant

Quaternions

Imaginary numbers is a misnomerâ€” they are real too

Linear Algebra and Calculus!
