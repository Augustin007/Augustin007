# Austin Garcia

I am a 17 year old programmer and mathematician.

I am currently studying for a degree in Electrical Engineering and Mathematics at UCSD

## Programming

I know MWEX, Python, C, and C++, but I mostly just use python.

My current project '[usefulpy](https://github.com/Augustin007/usefulpy)' a program that is essentially a large library of functions that improve the quality of python programming. One catch, it can't use any sort of third party libraries... so no numpy, scipy, manim, or any others... 

I use Visual Studio Code and Ipython for programming.

I am debating including compiled C++ programs to improve speed, but I've never used python and C++ together, so that's what I am learning how to do.

## Other than programming

First and foremost am a Catholic! 

I listen to [relevant radio](https://relevantradio.com/)

I love reading, writing, and mathematics.

I play piano, saxophone, and guitar. 

I love theatre (The last time I was in a play I was Lumiere in Beauty and the Beast, this is absolutely my favourite play). 

My non-programming languages are Spanish, English, and French.

I do gymnastics and martial arts.

### Book recomendations

I mentioned I love reading!

I love reading!

Alot!

So a few book recommendations:

Anything by Tolkein (Tolkein is my favorite)

Anything by C.S. Lewis

The Count of Monte Cristo (Alexandre Dumas)

The Complete Sherlock Holmes (Author Conlan Doyle)

The Shadow Children (Margaret Peterson Haddix) (This is an easy but excellent read)

## Mathematics

My favorite number is 6.928203230275509174109536602... 

Tau is the True Circle Constant

Quaternions

Imaginary numbers is a misnomerâ€” they are real too

Linear Algebra and Calculus!
